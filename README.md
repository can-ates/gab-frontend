## Gab 
Gab is a real-time chat app that you can create or join a room to interact with other people.


## Motivation
Real-time messaging apps have become an integral part of all the web users.
You nearly can't think of an app that does not have real-time functionality and It is something that every web developer should have experience with.
Feathers Js is a framework for real-time applications that I used in this project
